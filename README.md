Description
Calm Connect is an app for mental well-being, created with the purpose of aiming toward anxious, depressed, stressed, and people dealing with mood disorders. With the rapid pace of our modern lives, mental health problems are emerging day to day. Finding proper ways of dealing with them has never been as necessary as it is now. Calm Connect offers a holistic approach by taking into action the personal experiences—the questionnaires, games, book recommendations, and music therapy—to enhance mental relaxation and well-being.

Why Calm Connect?
Mental health is a global issue:

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 280 million suffer from depression.
The figures of anxiety disorders reach almost 264 million, rising annually.
Mental health disorders can lead to extreme impairments in physical health, productivity at work, and the quality of life in general. Studies show:
60% of employees report a reduction in productivity due to stress or mental health issues.
40% of all patients suffering from anxiety or depression stated that such problems interfered with functioning at work or school and/or with other daily activities.
But that is terrifying, and the challenge now is to develop effective strategies of management. Calm Connect steps up to offer tailored solutions as easily integrable instruments in everyday life to ward off those issues.
Why Games?
Therapeutic gaming has become a powerful tool for mental care. Here are some crucial statistics that portray the effectiveness of games in bettering mental well-being:

Reducing Anxiety and Stress: A study published by the journal Psychology of Popular Media indicated that the engagement with casual video games for half an hour significantly reduced anxiety and improved mood.
Another study was conducted that showed the stress level being decreased up to 20% through a couple of games.
Reduction of Mood Disorders
Evidence from the Journal of Affective Disorders research studies showed that playing video games that are intended to be more calming can help fight back depression by about 30%.
Those therapeutic game players believed that they were relaxed by about 40%. Cognitive Functions:

According to a review in Frontiers in Psychology, video games can encourage cognitive flexibility and problem-solving skills that assist gamers with managing stress and anxiety.
70% of the gamers have reported that video games help them move away from unwanted thoughts and emotions.
Engagement and Motivation:

A game is an interactive interface that can encourage users to engage in self-care. Studies have established that 75 percent of clients with mental health issues sustain themselves to therapeutic activities more if the activities are made gamified.
Gamified concepts have proven to be effective in the pursuit of enhancing compliance to treatment regimens because they encourage users to use the services available to them
Social Network:

Multiplayer games can help with social interaction; it is often a dimension wherein many people have most of their needs disappointed because of loneliness-this is particularly common among those suffering from mental health disorders. A study showed that 63% of players reported that they feel less lonely in a multiplayer game experience compared to any single-player game.
By including therapeutic games in Calm Connect, we would leverage all of those advantages: providing users with entertaining, helpful methods to improve their mental well-being. It is a holistic approach: assessments customized for the user's need, games that benefit therapy outcomes, book recommendations, and music therapy for mental wellness.
 
Features
1. Custom Questionnaires
Calm Connect first requires its users to answer some quite highly specific questions to come to understand a user's current level of mental and emotional activation. It then uses that information to establish some of the most probable mental health issues a user may be dealing with in the form of anxiety, depression, or mood disorders.

Next, based on this understanding of the user's emotional environment, Calm Connect will provide the user with direct access to specific recommendations for relaxation exercises, games, books, and music therapy.

2. Therapeutic Games
For each mental problem, Calm Connect has a list of stress- and anxiety-reducing games that have been scientifically designed to reduce the levels. Games are offered as experiences which are interactive and focus more on creating a peaceful setting while giving the user relief from overwhelming emotions.
Examples include:
Anxiety Disorders. A recommended game for this disorder is My Oasis, since the game is calming and makes for relaxing settings that will have a user unwind with soothing music and calming environments.
Each of these mental health challenges has selected game suggestions specifically chosen to cater to their needs.
 3. Book Recommendations
Many find books comforting. Calm Connect offers a list of the most comforting book recommendations to lift someone's mind and spirit. These are carefully selected books that comfort and soothe a user's experience, helping one temporarily throw off mental pressure from everyday life.

280 Hz: Good for improving mental and physical well-being - fat-burning processes, for instance.
